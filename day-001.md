# Day 1 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*2022-08-01*

Infrastucture as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning servers through machine-readable defi1nition files, rather than manual configuration [1]. 

Motivations for adopting IaC are mobility between cloud providers, predictability, and improved security and governance controls [2].

**Why is security important for IaC?**

Misconfigurations can expose infrastructure to security risks. Solving security issues in run-time only works as mitigation, as the root of the problem is not fixed in the same action. Inherit misconfigured code will continue existing and being replicated in production.

Tools like Checkov provide a way for verifying that the code is correctly configured, avoiding security flaws before they reach production environments.


## Types of IaC

There are two types to IaC: declarative (functional) and imperative (procedural). 

The declarative focuses on *what* should be the target's configuration by defining the desired state of the target. It works as a list of requirements that the tooling executes to set up the configuration. CloudFormation and Terraform are examples of declarative IaC systems [3].

On the other hand, the imperative approach focuses on *how* the infrastructure can be changed to meet the desired configuration, usually by commands or scripts that must be executed to achieve the configuration goals â€” E.g. Bash, MS PowerShell, Ansible, Chef, etc [3].


## IaC Tools

- [Terraform](https://terraform.io)

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

- [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)

- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra)

- [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)


## Static Code Analysis Tools

- [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) Checkov is a static code analysis tool for scanning infrastructure as code (IaC) files for misconfigurations that may lead to security or compliance problems. Checkov includes more than 750 predefined policies to check for common misconfiguration issues. Checkov also supports the creation and contribution of custom policies. Checkov scans these IaC file types: Terraform (for AWS, GCP, Azure and OCI), CloudFormation (including AWS SAM), Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Serverless framework, Helm charts, Kubernetes, and Docker.


- [KICS](https://kics.io/) keeping infrastructure as code secure (KICS) is an open source solution for static code analysis of Infrastructure as Code. KICS finds security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations in following Infrastructure as Code solutions: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible. 1900+ queries are available.
